// EngineUi.h - narrow PUBLIC engine surface: the in-game co-op session panel +
// status overlay. Carved out of Engine.h (Phase 5a domain split, 2026-07-19) so
// the UI root (Plugin.cpp) includes only what it needs and the sync/replication
// consumers stop transitively seeing the panel API.
//
// Like Engine.h this is a PUBLIC header: it declares only the SEH-guarded engine
// facade and must NEVER pull in a <kenshi/...> internal header - those live in
// the adapter (EngineInternal.h). Forward declarations only.

// ---- In-game co-op session panel ---------------------------------------------
// A native DatapanelGUI opened with F2 that lets the player pick role + transport
// (buttons/checkboxes - the only reliably interactive DatapanelGUI controls;
// MyGUI comboboxes/editboxes have no usable RVAs and don't receive keyboard focus
// during gameplay) and Connect/Disconnect. The friend's Steam ID is entered by
// clipboard: "Copy my Steam ID" puts the player's own id on the clipboard to
// share, and "Paste friend's Steam ID" reads the friend's id back in (per-session,
// never written to disk). The UDP endpoint (ip/port) still comes from
// coop_config.json. The GUI layer stays session-agnostic: live status is passed IN
// via *st and the user's actions are handed BACK through the callbacks (the plugin
// root owns the session/config wiring). Main-thread only; SEH-guarded.

// Outbound Steam invite, as function pointers so this GUI layer stays free of the
// Steam/net code (the plugin root fills it from net/SteamInvite). The host opens
// a lobby + friend list with begin(), then invite(id) sends a Steam lobby invite;
// the friend accepts from Steam and both sides connect - no Steam IDs swapped.
// friendState: 0 offline, 1 online, 2 playing Kenshi (the list is sorted by it).
